		<p><span>Reform clergyman Rick Jacobs, who serves as president of the Union for Reform Judaism, recently made a comment of interest to a secular Jewish newspaper. It was in response to chareidi opposition in Israel to a plan that would set aside an area adjacent to the Kosel Maaravi to accommodate unorthodox services. But his words were also aimed at the larger issue of religious standards in Israel for things like geirus, gittin v'kiddushin and the official recognition and government funding of Jewish movements that do not accept halachah as the arbiter of Jewish religious questions. What the Reform leader said was that, if Israel shuns compromise with the American Reform movement, &quot;it will signal a serious rupture in the relationship between Diaspora Jewry and the Jewish state.&quot; And he went on to contend that &quot;Reform Jewish leaders speak up every day on behalf of the State of Israel on the college campus and in our communities. We are asked to speak up for Israel, even as Israel treats Reform Judaism as inauthentic.&quot; If, by that latter statement, Jacobs means to imply that Reform Jews' support for Israel is contingent on the state's adoption of the Reform movement's religious matters determinations as an official counterpart to Israel's halachah-respecting standard, it is astonishingly revealing. Threatening to hold his constituents' support for Israel hostage until his movement is considered equal with the Judaism of the ages says much about the depth of Reform commitment to Israel's security...</span></p>
